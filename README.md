Problem:
'How might we encourage customers to book flights using their travel voucher?'

Our Solution:
Simplify the user experience by easing their mental load -> by reducing the number of clicks needed to use eVouchers.


Next Steps:
- Slider of more personalised destination cards
- Overlay feature to be on each page of BA's website
